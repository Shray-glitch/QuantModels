# QuantModels

A collection of quantitative finance models and simulations implemented in Python. This project is designed to help understand and apply foundational techniques used in the field of computational finance.

## 🧠 What's Inside

This repository includes:

- 🧾 **Put Option Pricing**: Basic Black-Scholes implementation for European options.
- 🧮 **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Simulating asset price paths and pricing derivatives.
- 📈 **Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM)**: For modeling stock prices.
- 📊 **Portfolio Simulation & Risk Analysis**: Concepts from Quantitative Finance Udemy courses.
